# Web Audio API experiment

Messing around with the HTML5 Web Audio API - Just wanted to get a file loaded and played back, for now. It's very, very cool. I'd love to experiment with more features, like generating a waveform and using the analyzers on it. There's so much inside the API!

Used this guide to get going: [Getting Started With Web Audio API (html5rocks)](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)

### Things to add:

- <strike>Simple effect on buttonpress</strike>
- Input box with keyboard sounds?
- Volume slider
- Ability to choose file to play
- Load and play multiple files (buffer array?)
- Add effects using AudioNodes
- Generate oscilator tone
- View it back with some kind of visualisation
